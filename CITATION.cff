  This repository provides a containerized, reproducible viral metagenomics pipeline 
  for ecological studies in aquatic ecosystems under nutrient enrichment. It includes 
  tools for quality control, taxonomic classification, ecological diversity metrics, 
  and interactive manual analyses via Jupyter notebooks. Demonstrated on data from 
  the Cuatro Ci√©negas Basin, the pipeline emphasizes low-memory efficiency and 
  scientific reproducibility.
